<h1>My Page</h1>
<p>I have become passionate 
about free and open source
technology over the last 
6 years. Switching to Linux
opened many doors for me, 
ultimately leading me to learn
programming and take an interest in privacy and security.</p>
<p>I also enjoy traveling. 
Prepandemic I traveled for 
several months each year. Given 
I'm stuck at home for a while,
I've picked up gaming to keep busy and 
manage stress. </p>
